			<h1>
				<strong>ACM SIGCOMM SOSR Software Systems Award</strong>
			</h1>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				The ACM SIGCOMM SOSR Software Systems Award is given to an individual or an institution to recognize the development of a software system that has had a significant impact on software-defined networking (SDN) research, implementations, and tools. The impact may be reflected in the widespread adoption of the system, or of its underlying concepts, by the wider SDN community, either in research projects, in the open-source community, or commercially. The award includes a prize of $1,000. The award is presented at the Symposium on SDN Research (SOSR) each year and the winner is invited to give a talk at the conference.
			</p>

			Nominations should be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:sosr-award@sigcomm.org">sosr-award@sigcomm.org</a> on or before September 6th, 2021 to be considered for this year’s award.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A nomination for the Software Systems Award that is not selected may be re-submitted in following years, but after three successive unsuccessful submissions, should not be re-submitted for at least one year.

			<h2>Selection Process</h2>
			<p>
				The recipient of the award will be selected by a committee comprising the following members:
				<ul>
					<li>Three to four senior members of the SOSR community, selected by the SOSR steering committee, representing both academic and industrial perspectives.</li>
					<li>One member of the SOSR Steering Committee shall serve as an ex-officio member of the committee.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Any committee member who has a conflict of interest with a nominee or who feels that their association with a nominee would interfere with their ability to be impartial shall be excluded from the relevant parts of the discussion. For the purposes of this selection process, conflicts of interest will include: Ph.D. and postdoc advisors and advisees, scientific collaborators and co-authors within the past two years, immediate family members, and any relationships that involve a significant financial interest such as employment, grants, consulting, advisory boards, etc.
